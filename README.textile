h1. Prismatic Framework

Prismatic is my personal web-design framework. I created it because I wanted to have a tool perfectly adapted to the way I work. Thus, it’s not a "for everyone" framework.

h2. Getting Started

Put this in your HTML file, in the <code><head></code> section:

<pre>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="prismatic/prismatic.css" type="text/css">
</pre>

Then... Well, you have to wait, I still haven't written any guide... :/
