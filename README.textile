h1. Chunks

Chunks is a CSS layout system for those who don’t care about grids, CSS resets or fancy plug-ins. You can use it with any CSS framework, build on top of it, or just use it as it is with nothing else. Its size is very small (less than 1kb) and only embeds the minimum. There is no CSS reset nor plugins.
